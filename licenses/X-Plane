# Additional Terms for Jeppesen Data

YOU (herein also “End-User”) HAVE LICENSED JEPPESEN’S NAVDATA (“DATA”) (called “Products” hereinafter) FROM NAVIGRAPH KB (“OEM”) UNDER AN AGREEMENT (herein “Agreement”). PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL TERMS (“Additional Terms”) PROVIDED TO YOU BY OEM CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE PRODUCTS. THESE ADDITIONAL TERMS ARE LEGALLY BINDING UPON YOU IN ADDITION AND AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE AGREEMENT. BY YOUR BELOW SIGNATURE, END-USER IS AGREEING TO EACH TERM OF THESE ADDITIONAL TERMS AS PART OF THE AGREEMENT INCLUDING THE RESTRICTIONS ON USE, DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITIES. ANY USE OF THE PRODUCTS WILL ALSO CONSTITUTE YOUR AGREEMENT WITH THESE ADDITIONAL TERMS AS PART OF THE AGREEMENT. In case of a conflict between the Agreement and anything stated in these Additional Terms, these Additional Terms shall govern and prevail.

1. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

a. End-User acknowledges that the Agreement is concluded solely between OEM and End-User, and not with Jeppesen GmbH and/or Jeppesen Sanderson Inc. (“Jeppesen”). The parties acknowledge that OEM (and not Jeppesen) is responsible for addressing any claims of the End-User relating to the Products.
End-User acknowledges and agrees that Jeppesen is in respect of these Additional Terms a third party beneficiary of the Agreement, and that upon End-User’s acceptance of the Additional Terms, Jeppesen will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce the Additional Terms against End-User as a third party beneficiary of the Agreement.

b. End-User acknowledges and agrees that each NavData database is effective for the specific 28-day AIRAC cycle period for which it was produced. Jeppesen has no liability or responsibility of any kind for the use of NavData by End-User after the expiration of its AIRAC effectivity cycle. End-User agrees that any use of the NavData after the expiration date of the AIRAC effectivity cycle will be at the End-User&#39;s sole risk and responsibility.

c. Information contained in NavData is independently available from publications of the appropriate governing authority. NavData are designed for use by experienced and knowledgeable (i) pilots who must be thoroughly familiar with and competent in, among other things, the navigation of aircraft and the air navigation equipment being used, and (ii) flight dispatchers, flight planners and others who must be thoroughly familiar with and competent in, among other things, the planning of flights and the computerized flight planning programs being used. The NavData does NOT contain all information necessary to independently conduct instrument or visual flight procedures or plan all aspects of a flight. The NavData must be used in conjunction with the appropriate aeronautical charts and other information available to pilots, flight dispatchers, flight planners and others through a variety of sources. Pilots must conduct flight procedures in accordance with the information depicted on aeronautical charts.

d. Some information displayed by the system on which NavData is installed (“System”) may be solely generated by the System, and may not be information derived from Jeppesen NavData. The NavData provided hereunder may not contain all of the navigation data existing worldwide, and End-User should make no assumption otherwise. The System may not utilize all NavData available from Jeppesen, and the data contained in End-User’s NavData may be only a subset of the data available from Jeppesen.

e. End-User is the “end-user” of the data that is the subject of this Agreement, and Requirements and Technical Concepts for Aviation, Inc. (RTCA) document DO-200A and European Organization for Civil Aviation Equipment (EUROCAE) document ED-76, “Standards for Processing Aeronautical Data,” Section 1.4, Application of Standard, state that, “The ultimate responsibility of ensuring that data [i.e. NavData] meets the quality for its intended application rests with the end-user of that data.

f. End-User is solely responsible for (i) thoroughly and appropriately training its users on the use of the System and the contents of any reformatted data derived from NavData, including, among other things, its limitations and differences
from Jeppesen NavData, and (ii) training its users to confirm that the database information the user selects in the System is the database information the use intends to select.

3. RESTRICTIONS ON USE. The Products may not be used for any other purpose, nor be sold or given by End-User to any third party for any use.
